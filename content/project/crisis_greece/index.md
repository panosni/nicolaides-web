title: Greek Economic Crisis
summary: From 2014 to 2019 I worked on the Greek economic crisis, having served as Alternate Member to the Eurogroup Working Group for 3 years and having prepared about 30 Eurogroup/ECOFIN and 4 Euro Summit meetings. I oversaw the successful implementation of Greece's 3rd economic adjustment programme, contributed to the stabilisation of the economy and led the technical part of the debt relief negotiations, which resulted in substantial restructuring of the Greek public debt in August 2018. Picture from informal EuroWorking Group at Lake Bled, Slovenia on 9 June 2017 - an important meeting in completing the Greek economic adjustment programme and stabilising the public debt.
