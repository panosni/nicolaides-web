Welcome! I am Director of Research at the EU Tax Observatory, Paris School of Economics and PhD Researcher at the Hertie School, Berlin. I specialise in public economics and taxation, in particular tax compliance and the empirical analysis of tax policy using administrative data.

I am on the market for Assistant Professor positions in 2022-2023 and available for interviews at EJM and ASSA meetings. {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} Download my {{< staticref "uploads/nicolaides_cv_4_22.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV here{{< /staticref >}}.

My research uses administrative data and utilises discontinuities, exemptions and cut-offs created by policy to provide empirical evidence on economic behaviour and to estimate the effect on government revenue. Topics include novel forms of third-party reporting policy, tax lotteries and VAT incidence. You can find recent papers and ongoing projects in the {{< staticref "#research">}}research section{{< /staticref >}}.

The majority of my work is guided closely by policy developments, having spent the first part of my career (2013-2019) managing the Greek economic crisis in Brussels and Athens. Since 2021, I have been setting up the EU Tax Observatory in Paris; I direct its scientific programme, coordinate research output and manage relations with external stakeholders. You can find more in the {{< staticref "#policy">}}policy section{{< /staticref >}}.
