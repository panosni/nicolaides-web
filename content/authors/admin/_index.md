Welcome! 

I am a Research Associate at the EU Tax Observatory, Paris School of Economics and a PhD Researcher at the Hertie School, Berlin. 

My research focuses on public economics and taxation, in particular forms of tax compliance and policies to improve it. For my PhD, I have been analysing novel forms of third-party reporting using administrative data. You can find more in the {{< staticref "#research">}}research section{{< /staticref >}}.

My interests are guided closely by policy developments, having spent the first part of my career (2013-2019) managing the Greek economic crisis. Since 2021, I am setting up the EU Tax Observatory; I direct its scintific work programme, coordinate research output and manage external relations. You can find more in the {{< staticref "#policy">}}policy section{{< /staticref >}}.
