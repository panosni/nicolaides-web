Welcome! I am Director of Research at the EU Tax Observatory, Paris School of Economics. I specialise in public economics and taxation, in particular tax compliance and the empirical analysis of tax policy using administrative data.

My research uses administrative data and utilises discontinuities, exemptions and cut-offs created by policy to provide empirical evidence on economic behaviour and to estimate the effect on government revenue. Topics include novel forms of third-party reporting policy, tax lotteries and VAT incidence. You can find recent papers and ongoing projects in the {{< staticref "#research">}}research section{{< /staticref >}}.

The majority of my work is guided closely by policy developments, having spent the first part of my career (2013-2019) managing the Greek economic crisis in Brussels and Athens. Since 2021, I have been working on establishing the EU Tax Observatory in Paris; I direct its scientific programme, coordinate research output and manage relations with external stakeholders. You can find more in the {{< staticref "#policy">}}policy section{{< /staticref >}}.
