summary: "This paper documents an increase in VAT revenue and a limited, short-term change in payment preferences of individuals, in response to the introduction of a tax lottery in Greece. The scheme incentivises the use of electronic payments over cash to fight tax evasion by allocating \euro1 million in prizes every month. Tickets are awarded automatically when consumers complete retail transactions by electronic means. I exploit a delayed introduction of the lottery, where nine draws took place in a retroactive superdraw on Christmas Eve in 2017. Participation was unanticipated and tickets corresponded to electronic payments completed in previous months. By combining information from the universe of winners, a random sample of non-winners and monthly VAT revenue from regional tax offices, I estimate that a tax office's VAT revenue increased by 0.01\% per additional winner residing in the tax office's jurisdiction. Winners increased their electronic consumption by 14\%, but reverted gradually back to pre-winning spending levels after 6 months. In regions with a large number of winners, I document delayed spillover effects in the electronic consumption of non-winners, 5 to 7 months after the superdraw. The lottery's positive outcome demonstrates the potential of electronic payments to raise tax revenue. Their effect is limited by payment preferences, which appear to be resistant to change."
