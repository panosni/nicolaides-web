summary: "This paper documents an increase in VAT revenue and changes to payments behaviour of individuals, in response to the introduction of a tax lottery in Greece. The scheme incentivises the use of electronic payments over cash to fight tax evasion by allocating €1 million in prizes every month. Tickets are awarded automatically when consumers complete transactions by electronic means. I exploit a delayed lottery launch, where nine monthly draws took place in a retroactive superdraw on Christmas Eve in 2017. Participation was unanticipated and tickets corresponded to electronic payments completed in previous months. By combining information from the universe of winners, a random sample of non-winners and monthly VAT revenue from regional tax offices, I estimate that a tax office's VAT revenue increases by 0.01% per additional winner residing in the tax office's jurisdiction. Winners increased their electronic consumption by 14%, but reverted gradually back to pre-winning spending levels after 6 months. In regions with a large number of winners, I document spillover effects in the electronic consumption of non-winning individuals. While winning did not change payment habits permanently, the overall revenue effect was fiscally positive."
